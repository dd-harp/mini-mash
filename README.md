# mini-mash
the minimum viable simulation

## paper

* RM-delay: one example
* maybe predator-prey with some sort of delay?

## notes

for disaggregated sim with explicit exposed class to track exact output, store the trajectory as a set and then sort it by state change time. Push output *every* time something happens.
